# Get out pls!

I'm just tooling this around to prove out some stuff I'm a little rusty on. You
can track how I go through this and eventually lose interest as a I feel more
comfortable with what I'm working with.

## What Am I Making?

This project is going to be a simple webapp that lets a user manage a tournament
with a small number of entrants, and randomly seed them. This is primarily so I
can stop making up brackets for the MtG club at work.

## Primary Goals

This is a learning project.

### Learn Up on:

- Preact
- React Router 4

### Brush up on:
- Current state of all the tooling
- New eslint plugins
- Redux
  - Normalizer
  - Thunk
  - Forms

### Side Goals

- Implement a service worker, make a pass at lighthouse
- Express for backend I guess
- Attempt to port to Polymer Web Components, and another light stack thingie.
